The schema is fully described in ``CLAUDE.md``. Briefly:

* One :class:`LanguagePair` row per database (id always ``LanguagePair.SINGLETON_ID``).
* One :class:`Word` row per vocabulary entry.
* One :class:`Repetition` row per practice event, scoped to a single
  :class:`Direction` (source→target or target→source).
